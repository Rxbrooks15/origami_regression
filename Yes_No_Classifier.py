    ### üîç About the Model

    - **Binary Classification**:  
      The model decides between two classes: **Origami** or **Not Origami**.  
      A threshold of 0.5 determines the class.

    - **CNN vs. SVC**:  
      - This app uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which automatically learns visual features such as folds, edges, and textures.  
      - A **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**, often used in earlier origami classification research, works well with numerical features but typically requires handcrafted features from images (like edges or shape descriptors).  
      - CNNs generally outperform SVCs for complex image recognition tasks because they learn features directly from raw pixels.

    - **Confidence Score**:  
      Indicates how certain the model is about its prediction.
